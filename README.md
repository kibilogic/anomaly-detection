# Anomaly Detection

## Background
Inspired by some research exploring anomaly detection

## Questions I'd like to answer
What features best differentiate the unusual (anomalous) from legitimate emails?

How effective is anomaly detection in identifying phishing attacks?

How can the model detect indicators of compromise (IOCs) in emails?

How to mitigate privacy risks when using anomaly detection on email content?
